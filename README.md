# -Password-Analyzer
Developed a Python CLI tool to assess password strength and generate secure passwords. Used regex for validation and ensured strong standards with checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. Included an interactive menu and automation.
This is version 1 of this project, I will be adding a nice user interface where you can select if you want your password anaylzed or even generated for you.
